The advancements in computer vision with Deep Learning has been constructed and perfected with time,
primarily over one particular algorithm - a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Convolutional Neural network is a deep learning algorithm that takes in an input image,assign importance
to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other
Convolution Layer - The Kernel
3x3x1 matrix
Kernel.Filter, K =

1 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 1

The Kernel Shifts9 times because of stride length-1, every time performing a matrix multiplication operatiion 
between K and the portion P of the image over which the kernel is hovering
